This app is an free alternative to bKash payment verification API.
How it works :
> When bKash payment confirmation SMS arrives to phone, using Java code that SMS is read immediately
> Then the SMS is parsed, which mobile number it comes from and arrival time and Transaction ID etc. are parsed.
> That information is immediately sent to server. The app turns ON internet if not already ON
> This is how payment can be verified within few seconds
